              Working as a Home Health Professional is awesome, but let's be real - it can be as challenging as trying to solve a Rubik's Cube... blindfolded. I've seen it firsthand. My wife, a dedicated Speech Therapist, juggled her phone, planner, and an army of sticky notes (armed with a trusty pencil, of course) to make her schedule work. It was like watching a high-stakes Tetris game where the blocks were appointments and the game never ended.

               The number of "Arghs!" and "Oh no, I lost my spot...again!" moments were mounting. As a software engineer, I started thinking, "There has to be a less 'pull-your-hair-out' way to do this." So, I put on my developer hat and got to work, aiming to win back my wife's time (and sanity).

              Enter ScheduleAid: born from a blend of love, a dash of frustration, and a sprinkle of coding magic. After sharing it with the community and receiving enough warm responses to melt a snowman, I realized this wasn't just a pet project – it was a lifeline for Home Health pros.
